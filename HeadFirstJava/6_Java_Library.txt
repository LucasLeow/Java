== Prebuilt Classes ==
	- Don't have to reinvent wheel
	- Java library aka Java API
	- used like building blocks
	- just need to learn how to use it
	
	
	
== ArrayList ==
	
	import java.util.ArrayList;
	
	- Typically cannot use to store primitives
		- faster to store using Array
		
	- A class in core Java API (library)
		- add(obj)
		- remove (idx)
		- remove(obj)
		- contains(obj)
		- isEmpty()
		- indexOf(obj)
		- size()
		- get(idx)
		
		
		// <Egg> is the object stored inside the ArrayList
		ArrayList<Egg> myList = new ArrayList<Egg>();
		
		Egg a = new Egg();
		myList.add(a);
		myList.size();
		
		boolean isIn = myList.contains(a);
		int idx = myList.indexOf(a);
		
		boolean empty = myList.isEmpty();
		myList.remove(a);
		
		

== ArrayList vs Arrays ==
	- Array does not have methods except .length()
	
	- Size must be declared for Array
	- ArrayList is dynamic
	
	- Specific location must be provided for Array
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Boolean Operators
	AND : &&
	OR : ||
	NOT : !
	NOT EQUALS : !=
	
	
	

== Using Java API (Library) ==
	- classes grouped into packages (folders)
	
		- ArrayList in "util" package (folder)

	1) Import statement
		
		import java.util.ArrayList;
		
		Then can just type ArrayList
		
		
	2) Use full name everywhere
		- includes package name & class name
		
			- package name: java.util
			- class name: ArrayList
	
		java.util.ArrayList<Dog> myDogs = new java.util.ArrayList<Dog>;
		
		
	
	
	* java.lang don't have to import
		
== Purpose of packages ==
	- Organization (folders of related .java / .class codes)
	- namespacing (differentiate classes with same names)
	- security (restrict usage access to classes in same package)
	
	
	
== javax ==
	- extensions not included in the standard library
	
		- Standard Extensions
			- Sun considered official
			- "javax" term used
			- may eventually be upgraded to first-class (part of std lib)
			- current javax libraries are old extensions that got promoted to Std lib.
			
		- NonStandard Extensions
			- experimental / early access / beta
	


== Import statements ==
	- not the same as "include" in C language.
	- Does not make class memory size larger
	- Does not compile the imported class / package
	- Import is simply giving Java the full name of class
	
	
== java.lang package ==
	- The only std lib that don't have to import
		- String | System etc.
	- the very fundamentals
	
	

== How to navigate the Java API (Library) ==
	1) What classes are in the library?
			- Browse Books (Java in a Nutshell)
			
	2) How to know what classes can do?
		- Use HTML Java API docs (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)
		- give details about class & its methods
