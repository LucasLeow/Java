Java:
	- class based
	- object oriented programming (based on C & C++)
	- console | GUI | web | mobile | game development | embedded systems
		- televisions | washing machines | air-conditioners etc.
		
	- "Write-Once, Run Anywhere"
	
	- 3 Editions of Java (based on type of development)
		- Java Standard Edition (Java SE) (contain core libraries)
		- Java Enterprise Edition (APIs like JMS, EJB, JSP, Servlets etc.)
		- Java Micro Edition (Cellphones | set-top boxes | handhelds etc.)
		
		
	- Source Code (.java) -> Compiler -> bytecode (.class) -> Java Interpreter
		- .class files typically saved in "bin" dir
	
	- Java code run on JVM (Java virtual machine)
		- provides the runtime-environment
		
	
== Java Setup ==
	- Download the Java SDK 

== Java Syntax ==

* File name must be same as class name
	- to allow JVM to know entrypoint for program
	- if multiple classes within single source (.java) file,
		- multiple .class files will still be created
		- to distinguish entrypoint, JVM will look for name match


For Main.java:

	public class Main {

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}

	}
		


== Data Types in Java ==
	- int
	- float
	- double
