== Goals of Spring Framework ==
    - Lightweight development with Java POJO (Plain Old Java Objects)
    - Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling
    - Minimize boilerplate Java code
        - boilerplate: sections of repeated code in multiple places



- Core Container

    Spring Beans:
        - Objects that form backbone of app
        - managed by Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) containers

    SpEL:
        - Spring Expression Language
        - supports querying & manipulating object graph @ runtime
        - language used in config files to refer to other beans
    

- AOP:
    - Aspect Oriented Programming
    - Add application-wide services
        - Logging
        - Security
        - Transactions etc.
    - apply services to objects
    

- Data Access Layer:
    - For communicating with Database

    - JDBC: Java Database Connection
        - Spring provides helper classes to make DB access much easier (reduce source code by 50%)

    - ORM: Object Relational Mapping
        - hook into Hibernate / JPA (Java Persistence API)

        JPA: Java persistence API
            - Specification that defines an API 
            - Hibernate implements JPA
    
    - JMS: Java Message Service
         - Send message to message queue async
        
    - Transaction Manager provided by Spring
        - Transaction methods on Database calls & other stuffs
    

- Web Layer
    - Home for Spring MVC framework
    - Build webapp using Spring Core | Spring Controllers | Spring Views


Test Layer
    - for test driven development
    - Mock Objects for mocking servlets (extend capabilities of server)
    - Out-of-container testing

    - Integration testing
        - create app & testing
