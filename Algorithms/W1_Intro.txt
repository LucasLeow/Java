Algorithms
	- Method for solving problem
	- for intellectual stimulation
	- to become proficient programmer
		- Bad programmers worry about code
		- Good programmers worry about data structures & their r/s
		
Data Structures
	- Method to store information
	
	
Programs = Data Structures + Algorithms




== Packages ==
	- essentially directories storing java files
	
	eg:
		"tools" dir
			- AdvCalc.java
			- Calc.java
		
		- main.java
		

		* Inside main.java:
			
			import tools.Calc; // to use Calc object within main class
			


== .jar files ==

	- Java Archive files
	- Right click & unzip to desired project folder
	- import according to package technique above
