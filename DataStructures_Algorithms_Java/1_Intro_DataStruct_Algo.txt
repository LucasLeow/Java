== 1 Intro to Data Structures ==
    - a way to organize data
    - use data structures to organize huge data into memory
        - easier to process
        - efficiently access data
    eg:
        - messy library with books everywhere
        - take a lot of time to find particular book
        vs
        - neatly arranged books by authors name
        - faster to find books

    -- types of data structures --
        1) Linear
            - data arranged sequentially
            - each member connected to previous & next element
            - easy to traverse (single level)
            - easy to implement  (stored sequentially)
            - Array | LinkedList | Stacks | Queues

        2) Non-Linear
            - data arranged not in sequence
            - connected through different paths
            - multiple levels (different ways to traverse)
                - need more time to traverse
            - not easy to implement
            - Tree | Graph

== 2 Intro to Algorithms ==
    - Set of instructions to perform task / solve problem
    - typically done with pseudo-coding then implemented with code 
        - sequence of steps
        - implement code
        - test / troubleshoot
